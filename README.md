Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

Trends:
Charter schools are the highest performing schools (by % overall passing) and the district schools are worse performing. Combined the charter schools have a % overall passing of 90% and the district schools have a combined % of 54%. This shows us that the charter schools perform much better academically.

The larger schools perform significantly worse than the smaller schools. The schools with that has a spending range on students less than $585 had the highest % overall passing. The more money spent per student indicated a less likelihood of passing. This correlates with the size of school as the larger schools had more budget per student.
